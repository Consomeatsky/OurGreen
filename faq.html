    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <p> <span class="faq-title">How do I get my organization listed?</span>

        Easy! Just complete this survey. We will use the info you provide to create your listing. Once it is live, we will contact you with a confirmation. Or, just contact us with a link to your website and/or social media presence and we’ll create the listing for you.
        
         
        
        How long does it take to approve a listing?
        
        In most cases, we’ll have your listing live within 24 to 48 hours.
        
         
        
        How much does a listing cost?
        
        You tell us! What is our service worth to you? While we do not charge to have a listing, we suggest a $100 donation per year which helps us defray the cost of keeping the site running and up to date!
        
         
        
        My listing has an error or is incomplete. What do I do?
        
        Our goal is to have the most up-to-date directory of environmental groups anywhere. Just let us know the specific error, and we will be happy to fix it.
        
         
        
        <span class="faq-title">How long will my organization be listed?</span>
        
        As long as we’re around, you’ll be in our directory, unless you request to be removed.
        
         
        
        Under what circumstances would a listing be removed?
        
        There are only a few circumstances that would warrant the deletion of a listing: 1) If the organization requests it, 2) If the organization’s contact information (web address, phone, email, social media addresses, etc) becomes out of date, lapses or we can no longer make contact, and 3) If the organization engages in activities that are outside the Go Green Go mission.
        
         
        
        What if I don’t want my organization to be listing on GoGreenGo.org?
        
        No problem at all. Just contact us, and we will remove your listing right away. But we think you’ll want to stay! GoGreenGo.org is an excellent, FREE way to promote your grassroots environmental organization and grow your membership and awareness!
        
         
        
        Is my organization eligible to be listed?
        
        As long as you are a non-profit with an environmental mission, yes!. Review our list of categories to see if your organization fits. We can always add additional categories at the discretion of our management.
        
         
        
        You guys are awesome! How do I contribute?
        
        We are actively looking for supporters and donors, and would be grateful for your contribution of any size. This is a labor of love. But it does take money to run the show!</p>
